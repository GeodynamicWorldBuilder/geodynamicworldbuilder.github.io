We are pleased to announce that the code for release 0.2.0 can be considered stable. This means that all major changes on the todo list have been implemented, the manual is updated to the changes made since version 0.1.0, and the code seems to function as expected. Keep in mind that the Geodynamic World Builder is still a code in the beta phase and problems can be expected to arise when the code is used. In those cases we strongly recommend reporting the problems back to the developers.

We wish you a lot of fun with creating your models through the Geodynamic World Builder!
